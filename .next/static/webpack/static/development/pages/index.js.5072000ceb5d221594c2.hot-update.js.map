At my internship my project was \r\n                    to create a front-facing visual to display how the Xfinity Fraud Managment (XFM) team monitored and mitigated fraud activity.\r\n                    For that project I displayed the ~40 use cases of potentially fraudulent activity and plotted the occurence of each point. The \r\n                    app allowed for you to filter which items you wanted to look at as well as select the timeframe on which you were looking.\r\n                    I recreated that project using data from my tutoring experience at NYU. Here I display when each student would approach various tutors\r\n                    and the success of the tutoring session. The key features of this project were: \r\n                </p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Built using <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">React.js</a></li>\r\n                    <li>Data was read from Cassandra DB (now static data)</li>\r\n                    <li>Used D3 libraries to scale and plot data points according to their dates</li>\r\n                    <li>Used D3 libraries to create a window frame to adjust the date window of viewing</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </section>\r\n            <section>\r\n                <h3>K-Means Demo</h3>\r\n                <p>This project is a self-made data clustering algorithm that I created for my predictive analytics class. The algorithm takes in 24\r\n                    documents roughly concerned with 3 topics (Mouth and Foot Diseases, Airline Safety, and International Housing Prices) and clusters\r\n                    them into k centroids. The data is 1st converted into a tf-idf matrix adjusted for the lengths of the respective documents. The data\r\n                    is then trimmed by removing low intra-dimensional words, combining highly correlated dimensions, and then adjusting the matrix using PCA.\r\n                    The similarity is measured using cosine similarity into clusted determined by initial means furthest away from each other (see K-Means++).\r\n                    After the data is clustered it is then transformed again by PCA onto 2 dimensions and plotted on a 2-D graph. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Built in Java</li>\r\n                    <li>Used Apache Commons Math for vector/matrix manipulation</li>\r\n                    <li>Used JFree charts to create plots</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </section>\r\n        </Layout>\r\n        </>\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Index;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAEA;AAEA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;;;;AA3CA;AACA;AA6CA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
