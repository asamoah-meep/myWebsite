                <p>Hey, looks like you found my website!</p>
                <p>My name is Jeffrey Asamoah, and I'm currently living in the NYC metropolitan area.
                    I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at New York University and recently graduated 
                    in May 2020. My hobbies include running, coding, and 3-D modelling.

                <Dropdown title="Timeline App">
                <p>I created this timeline app to emulate the project I worked on during my Comcast Internship. At my internship my project was 
                    to create a foward-facing visual to display how the Xfinity Fraud Managment (XFM) team monitored and mitigated fraud activity.
                    For my internship I displayed the ~40 use cases of potentially fraudulent activity and plotted the occurences of each usecase. The 
                    app allowed for you to filter which items you wanted to look at as well as select the timeframe on which you were looking.
                    I recreated that project using data from my tutoring experience at NYU. Here I display when each student would approach various tutors
                    and the success of the tutoring session.

                    <p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering" target="_blank">K-Means</a> project is a self-made data clustering algorithm that 
                        I created for my predictive analytics class. The algorithm takes in 24 documents roughly concerned with 3 topics (Mouth and Foot Diseases, 
                        Airline Safety, and International Housing Prices) and clusters them into k centroids. The data is 1<sup>st</sup> converted into a TF-IDF matrix adjusted for 
                        the lengths of the respective documents. The data is then trimmed by removing low intra-dimensional words, combining highly correlated dimensions, 
                        and then adjusting the matrix using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis" target="_blank">PCA</a>.The similarity is 
                        measured using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity" target="_blank">cosine similarity</a> into clusted determined by initial 
                        means furthest away from each other (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B" target="_blank">K-Means++</a>). 
                        After the data is clustered it is then transformed again by PCA onto 2 dimensions and plotted on a 2-D graph.

                        This project was to build a mobile-friendly web page to demo the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank">QR codes </a> 
                        in advertising. QR codes are functionally 2-D bar codes and since most mobile phones come equipped to scan them, it makes sense to leverage them for 
                        quick access to a web page. The page makes use of CSS media queries and 
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design" target="_blank"> Responsive Design Practices</a> to be responsive

                    <p>
                        The website you see here was built using Next.js. a server-side framework built on top of React. I wanted to create
                        a website to showcase all of projects and work that I am proud of. Since it is important to demo projects as transparently
                        and seemlessly as possible it made sense to host it all on a single website. This website will continuously be a work in progress
                        as I try to implement and add both new features and new projects.

                <Dropdown title='OCR API'>
                    <p>My 1st project at GEP was to help construct an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">API </a> 
                        for our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" target="_blank"> Optical Code Recognition (OCR)</a> project. 
                        Our API would recieve data from the AI that read the data (in our case invoices), identify key elements and information, save it into our database, and try
                        to create the invoice on our service with the data. My role was was to create unit tests for new components, migrate data accessing
                        points to seperate API calls for security/independence, and implement new errors for missing information within the documents. This 
                        project is one of the 1st enterprise projects I've worked on with a team and it has taught me a lot about the importance of communication,
                        both in clarity of code and working with colleges. </p>
